# **About Me**

Hi I am **{{ site.author.name }}**.<br>

I'm an undergraduate student at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC), pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Information Sciences + Data Science with a minor in Computer Science. I’m on track to graduate in August 2025. My coursework spans machine learning, data science, algorithms, systems programming, and web design, which has shaped my interest in research at the intersection of intelligent systems and human-centered design.<br>

My research interests lie at the intersection of human-AI interaction, large language models, and software engineering. I’m particularly interested in how humans collaborate with intelligent systems to solve complex, technical problems—such as programming, debugging, and code comprehension.<br>

Outside the classroom, I’ve contributed to several research projects that combine empirical analysis with practical applications. Currently, I’m a research intern in the Human-Centered Software Systems Lab at Purdue University, where I collaborate on studies involving large language models (LLMs) and code generation. One of our recent papers, Where Do Large Language Models Fail When Generating Code, was published at the International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE).
