# Remediating Kell (2015)

As part of our **Writing Across Media 303** group project, we created a multimodal response to [Kell’s 2015 paper](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10350330.2015.1060666). The project explored how meaning moves across contexts and through material and semiotic forms. We chose to express our interpretation through an interactive **website prototype designed in Figma**, focusing on themes such as materiality, agency, and resemiotization.

This [site](https://www.figma.com/proto/ESDSLJmA21GJMJMXJhAHNd/Group-5?node-id=1-3&p=f&t=fB0s8Vsknxkspjn2-0&scaling=min-zoom&content-scaling=fixed&page-id=0%3A1&starting-point-node-id=1%3A3) reimagines Kell’s key arguments as a visual and interactive experience, mapping how meanings are remediated across different media.
